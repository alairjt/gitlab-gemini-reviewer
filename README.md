# GitLab Gemini Reviewer

An automated code review assistant powered by Google's Gemini AI. This tool analyzes GitLab Merge Requests, provides feedback as comments, creates Jira tickets, and generates QA test plans, streamlining your development workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Leverages the Gemini API to perform detailed code reviews.
- **Inline MR Commenting**: Posts suggestions and issues as discussions directly on the relevant code lines in the merge request.
- **Overall Summary**: Adds a general summary comment to the MR with a quality score.
- **Automatic Approval**: Can automatically approve merge requests that meet a configurable quality threshold.
- **Seamless Jira Integration**:
  - Creates a specific sub-task for the code review under the main story.
  - Generates and posts a detailed QA test plan as a comment on the parent ticket.
- **Multi-language Support**: Can provide feedback in English or Brazilian Portuguese.
- **Highly Configurable**: All parameters are controlled via environment variables, making it perfect for CI/CD environments.

## üöÄ How It Works

1.  **Trigger**: The tool is designed to be run in a CI/CD pipeline when a merge request is created or updated.
2.  **Fetch Diffs**: It fetches the code changes (diffs) from the specified GitLab merge request.
3.  **Analyze**: It sends the code, along with contextual information from the MR title and description, to the Gemini API for analysis.
4.  **Post Feedback**: It parses the AI's response and posts feedback to GitLab:
    - A general summary note.
    - Discussions attached to specific lines of code for each identified issue.
5.  **Integrate with Jira**:
    - It extracts the Jira ticket key from the MR title (e.g., `PROJ-123`).
    - Creates a "Code Review" sub-task.
    - Generates a complete QA test plan and posts it as a comment on the main Jira ticket.

gemini-reviewer
```

If you encounter a `command not found` error, it means the installation directory is not in your shell's `PATH`. You can either add it or run the tool as a module:

```bash
python -m gitlab_gemini_reviewer.gemini_mr_review
```
