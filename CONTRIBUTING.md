## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

### Reporting Bugs

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/alairjt/gitlab-gemini-reviewer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.
